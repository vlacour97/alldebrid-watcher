[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V6HX49E)

Alldebrid-watcher is an open-source application that allows for automatic downloading of torrent files using AllDebrid services. The application is divided into 4 configurable services: Watcher, Debrider, Downloader, and Notifier.

> **Important Information**   
> If you are using a version older than 2.0.0, please refer to [the old documentation](https://github.com/vlacour97/alldebrid-watcher/tree/1.1.1)

## How the app works ?

The application is divided into 5 parts:
* **AppKernel**
* **Watchers**
* **Debrider(s)** (other debriders may come later)
* **Downloaders**
* **Notifiers**

![](docs/structure.png)


### AppKernel

Enables the operation of the application by calling different services

### Watchers

Monitors torrent files or magnets to be downloaded.

Available Watchers:
* **FileSystem**: Monitors a folder and downloads a torrent as soon as a file is dropped.
* Coming soon

> Only one watcher can be used at a time

### Debriders

Transforms a torrent or magnet file into a direct link

Available Debriders:
* [**Alldebrid**](https://alldebrid.fr/)
* May come in the future

> Only one debrider can be used at a time

### Downloaders

Downloads a file transformed by the debrider

Available Downloaders:
* **FileSystem**: Uses node JS to download the file locally
* Coming soon

> Only one downloader can be used at a time


### Notifiers

Notifies the user of actions taken. It is possible to select which actions you want to be informed of.

Possible notification types:
* A torrent or magnet file was found
* A torrent or magnet file was debridled
* The download of a file has begun
* Download progress (x% downloaded)
* The download is finished
* The download encountered an error

Available Notifiers:
* **Stdout**: Log action in console
* **Pushover**: Sends notifications using the [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) service
* **Webhook**: Send HTTP POST Request to server endpoint

> **Multiple notifiers can be used at the same time**  
> Each notifier can inform of different actions (example: Stdout => verbose mode + Pushover => Downloads started, Downloads finished)

## Usage with Node JS

### Prerequisites

- A valid AllDebrid account with an [API key](https://alldebrid.fr/apikeys/)
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

Clone the Github repository on your machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlacour97/alldebrid-watcher.git
```

Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:
``` bash
npm install ts-node -g
npm install 
```

or

``` bash
yarn install ts-node -g
yarn install 
```

### Launch

Each service can be configured independently using [environment variables](#Configuration)

#### Basic usage example

Launch the application using npm or yarn:

``` bash
ALLDEBRID_TOKEN=allbredid-token  TORRENT_FOLDER=path/to/torrents DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=path/to/downloads npm run start
```

or

``` bash
ALLDEBRID_TOKEN=allbredid-token  TORRENT_FOLDER=path/to/torrents DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=path/to/downloads yarn start
```

## Use with Docker

### Prerequisites

- A valid AllDebrid account with an [API key](https://alldebrid.fr/apikeys/)
- Docker

### Lancement

Each service can be configured independently using [environment variables](#Configuration)

#### Basic usage example

``` bash
docker run -v path/tot/torrent:/torrents -v path/to/download:/downloads -e ALLDEBRID_TOKEN=allbredid-token vlacour97/alldebrid-watcher
```

The options used in this command are:

-   `-e ALLDEBRID_TOKEN` : sets the environment variable for your AllDebrid token
-   `-v <path/to/torrents>:/app/torrents` : binds the local folder containing the torrent files to the folder in the container where the application will look for torrent files
-   `-v <path/to/downloads>:/app/downloads` : binds the local folder where downloaded files will be saved to the folder in the container where the application will save downloaded files
